## Engineering Perception for the Real World

At *Boston Dynamics*, I worked on the cutting edge of robotics‚Äîbuilding backend and vision systems for Spot that allowed it to interpret and react to its environment in real time.

## Real-Time Vision with TensorFlow and OpenCV

I built **computer vision pipelines** for object detection and spatial awareness, leveraging:
- **TensorFlow**, **YOLO**, and **OpenCV**
- Live camera feeds and sensor fusion for real-time inference
- Optimized models to run on embedded hardware in edge conditions

These systems enabled Spot to recognize obstacles, navigate dynamic environments, and carry out tasks with precision.

## Sensor Data Streaming and Model Interfaces

Designed and implemented backend modules using:
- **gRPC** and **Protobuf** for efficient sensor data communication
- Interfaces to external model servers for continuous inference
- Modular, low-latency systems to maintain performance in high-noise environments

This architecture allowed for fast data retrieval, processing, and decision-making critical to autonomous behavior.

## Edge-Based AI Model Deployment

Managed cloud workflows and on-device deployment pipelines using:
- **AWS IoT Greengrass**
- Custom CI/CD pipelines for model training and deployment
- Automated dataset uploads and telemetry monitoring

This enabled us to update models in the field, adapt to new environments, and reduce development cycle times.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working with real-time robotics required reconciling the unpredictability of the physical world with the rigor of production systems. I learned to optimize for latency, fault tolerance, and modularity‚Äîlaying a strong foundation for future AI-first systems that operate under real-world constraints.
