## An AI Persona Built for Fans

Working directly with *Avori Henderson*—gamer, influencer, and TV personality—I built a hyper-personalized **AI replica** that allows her to interact with fans 24/7. The digital version of Avori uses her real voice and facial likeness, delivering a fully immersive fan experience powered by LLMs and multimodal AI.

The avatar captures her tone, personality, and conversational style—bridging the gap between creators and their community through next-gen engagement.

## Problem: Scalable Creator-Fan Connection

Influencers face increasing demand to connect personally with fans, but time, availability, and reach limit how much they can interact. We wanted to create:
- 🗣️ A **replica of Avori’s voice** for real-time dialogue
- 🎥 A **video avatar** that mimics her expressions and personality
- 🧠 A smart LLM agent trained on her content, tone, and FAQs
- 🌎 A platform-agnostic solution that can live on Twitch, Discord, and custom sites

## My Contribution

I led the full pipeline—from data collection to avatar deployment:
- Used **ElevenLabs** for ultra-realistic voice cloning based on custom studio audio
- Built a facial avatar using **Synthesia** and custom mouth/keyframe tuning
- Designed **LLM prompts and memory layers** to reflect her tone and preferred responses
- Built the web-based chat interface using **React** and **Next.js**, and wired backend APIs in **Node.js** and **Python**
- Integrated **vector search** and **content retrieval** trained on her interviews, streams, and brand guidelines

## Features Delivered

- 🎤 **AI chat with Avori’s voice** via ElevenLabs streaming
- 🎬 **Responsive video avatar** that blinks, speaks, and reacts naturally
- 💬 **Conversational LLM agent** trained on her bio, public content, and Q&A history
- 🌐 **Cross-platform interface** deployable to fan sites, Twitch bots, and Discord
- 🧠 **Memory-enabled threads** for fan personalization and contextual replies
