## Real-Time Voice AI for Financial Services

*Aviary AI* powers real-time voice assistants designed to help credit unions, banks, and insurers automate outbound communication. Using **GPT-4**, **LangChain**, and cloud-native infrastructure, these agents engage customers with human-like conversations—handling everything from disclosures to appointment scheduling.

The platform leverages **Twilio**, **Vapi**, and **ElevenLabs** for voice, transcription, and real-time dialog. A web interface built with **React + Next.js** allows business teams to launch compliant campaigns without writing code.

## The Problem

- **Limited Outbound Calls**: Only 18% of banks, credit unions, and insurance companies make outbound calls, missing crucial engagement opportunities throughout the customer lifecycle.
- **Inefficiency and Missed Opportunities**: Internal employees, often untrained or unmotivated, handle outbound calls—leading to incomplete interactions and lost revenue.
- **Challenges with GenAI Adoption**: Financial institutions hesitate to use general-purpose models like ChatGPT due to transparency and regulatory compliance concerns.
- **Complex Interactions**: Automating post-call workflows (e.g., opening new accounts, activating cards) is difficult due to integration challenges across systems.

## Our Impact

- **Proven Success Rate**: 26% of our AI-driven calls have resulted in successful customer interactions, significantly boosting engagement and revenue for our clients.
- **High Interaction Rate**: 72% of answered calls involved interactions beyond a simple “hello”.
- **Service Agent for Financial Institutions**: Designed specifically to handle sensitive workflows and build trust in highly regulated environments.

## Technologies Used

- **GPT-4, LangChain, Hugging Face**: AI-driven dialog generation and chaining.
- **Twilio, Vapi, ElevenLabs**: Voice synthesis, call routing, and transcription.
- **Next.js, React, TypeScript**: Custom dashboards and campaign configuration tools.
- **Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda**: Serverless backend services.
- **Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform**: Scalable and compliant infrastructure deployment.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing real-time voice responsiveness with LLM latency was a significant challenge. We implemented intelligent caching and tuned prompt complexity to ensure conversational fluidity. Regulatory compliance (e.g. TCPA) added further complexity, requiring coordinated workflows across AI, legal, and infrastructure teams.

## Outcome

The Aviary AI platform is now live across several financial institutions, achieving:
- 40% improvement in customer engagement for dormant outreach
- 60% reduction in agent call volume for disclosures and activation
- Seamless cross-functional handoffs with auditable AI logs

The solution is modular and extensible, laying the foundation for intelligent outbound voice automation across regulated industries.

## Why Now?

In the face of financial and regulatory pressures, banks, credit unions, and insurance companies are hesitant to adopt new technologies due to compliance fears. *Aviary AI* addresses this by offering a vertical-specific LLM, fine-tuned with industry data to tackle the unique challenges of financial services.
