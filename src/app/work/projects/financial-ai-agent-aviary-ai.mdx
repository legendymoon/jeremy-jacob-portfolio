## Intelligent Voice Automation for Financial Institutions

*Aviary AI* helps financial services automate outbound customer communication through lifelike voice agents. Built with **GPT-4**, **LangChain**, and **real-time audio APIs**, the platform delivers compliant, high-fidelity voice conversations for banks, credit unions, and insurers.

My role focused on building the full-stack architecture: from AI prompt engineering and call orchestration to infra deployment and the React-based dashboard. I helped ship reliable, scalable voice workflows that are transforming how institutions engage their customers.

## The Opportunity: Unlocking Outbound Engagement

Most financial institutions struggle to scale personalized outreach. Key challenges include:
- 📞 **Low outbound volume**: Only ~18% of institutions use outbound calling—leaving major engagement gaps.
- ⚙️ **Manual inefficiencies**: Outreach depends on internal staff, often untrained, inconsistent, and expensive.
- 🔍 **Compliance hesitation**: Widespread reluctance to adopt GenAI due to regulatory risk and lack of transparency.
- 🔌 **Integration barriers**: Connecting call outcomes to downstream systems (e.g., card activation, CRM) is fragile and error-prone.

## What I Built

I contributed across the entire voice intelligence stack:
- Built **voice agent workflows** using **LangChain**, **GPT-4**, and **retrieval-augmented pipelines** for contextual calls.
- Integrated **Vapi**, **Twilio**, and **ElevenLabs** for transcription, call routing, and expressive voice synthesis.
- Designed a **no-code React/Next.js dashboard** for campaign configuration, analytics, and post-call workflows.
- Deployed microservices and RAG backends on **AWS Lambda** and **Node.js**, orchestrated via **Kubernetes** and **Terraform**.
