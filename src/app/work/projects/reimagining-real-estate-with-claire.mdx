## AI for the Modern Homebuyer

At *reAlpha*, I helped engineer **Claire**—a generative AI-powered smart buyer’s agent that redefines how people buy homes. Claire eliminates the need for traditional agents, offering 24/7 assistance across every step of the homebuying journey—from budgeting and browsing to submitting offers and closing deals.

My contributions spanned backend infrastructure, AI agent logic, frontend UX, and real-time data integrations.

## The Challenge: Buying a Home Is Still Hard

Despite advances in fintech and proptech, homebuying remains complex, slow, and expensive. Key barriers included:
- 💰 **Lack of budget clarity**: Buyers struggle to calculate affordability and financing.
- 🏡 **Manual search fatigue**: Hundreds of listings, but little personalization.
- 📑 **Offer uncertainty**: Most buyers are unfamiliar with making competitive offers.
- ⏱️ **No real-time support**: Agents aren’t always available when needed, and commissions create misaligned incentives.

## My Role in Building Claire

As part of reAlpha’s engineering team, I worked on:
- Designing and deploying **RAG workflows** that power Claire’s contextual conversations using home listings, mortgage rules, and local zoning data.
- Integrating **GPT-4**, **Langchain**, and **vector databases** to handle multi-turn property searches and offer guidance.
- Building the **React + Next.js** frontend for Claire’s web UI and mobile-ready chat interface.
- Scaling backend systems with **Go**, **Python**, and **Node.js**, hosted on **AWS** and **GCP**.
- Connecting real-time MLS APIs and third-party services for affordability estimation and offer composition.

## Key Features I Helped Implement

- 🧠 **Zero-commission buyer logic**: AI-first guidance that eliminates traditional agent fees while improving clarity and trust.
- 🏠 **Personalized discovery**: Listings tailored to buyer preferences, affordability, and neighborhood fit.
- 💬 **Real-time, multi-modal assistant**: Integrated chat, voice, and document preview through APIs like **Synthesia** and **ElevenLabs**.
- 📊 **Budget-to-offer journey**: Dynamic budget calculator, lender matching, and offer strategy—all AI-augmented and automated.
