## Bringing Enterprise AI to the Middle East

*MAFGPT* is a custom, secure large language model platform developed for **Majid Al Futtaim (MAF)**—one of the UAE’s largest private companies. Modeled after ChatGPT, MAFGPT serves internal employees and external clients across business units like retail, real estate, and entertainment.

It offers real-time, intelligent responses for FAQs, operations, HR, procurement, and customer support—all within a private cloud environment.

## The Challenge: Secure, On-Brand Generative AI

MAF wanted to bring LLM-powered chat capabilities to its thousands of employees and customer service agents—but faced key enterprise constraints:
- 🛡️ **Data privacy & security**: No sensitive information could leave UAE-based clouds
- 🌍 **Multilingual support**: Needed to serve users in Arabic and English
- 🧠 **Custom knowledge base**: Must reference MAF-specific docs, policies, and internal SOPs
- 👩‍💼 **Role-aware conversations**: Different user groups (e.g. HR, Retail Ops) needed tailored behaviors

## What I Delivered

I led full-stack and AI implementation efforts to bring MAFGPT from prototype to production:
- Designed a **LangChain-based agent** with tools for summarization, internal doc search, and form generation
- Implemented **RAG pipelines** using a secure **vector database**, supporting thousands of internal PDFs and SharePoint sources
- Built the frontend interface with **React + Next.js**, styled to match MAF’s internal brand system
- Integrated **Azure OpenAI** for LLM APIs, deployed entirely on **private Azure cloud** for regional compliance
- Developed **admin dashboards** for prompt versioning, usage tracking, and role-based access control
