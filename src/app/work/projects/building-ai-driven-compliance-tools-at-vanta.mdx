## Building Trust with AI at Scale

At *Vanta*, I led the development of security and compliance automation features that powered trust management for 8,000+ customers. My work spanned LLM integration, infrastructure reliability, and feature-rich enterprise dashboards.

/>

## The Problem

- **Manual Security Reviews**: Customers spent hours filling out vendor security questionnaires, delaying deals and audits.
- **Compliance Complexity at Scale**: As customers grew, compliance workflows became harder to manage and monitor.
- **Real-Time Performance Issues**: Increasing traffic demanded a scalable, low-latency backend.

## Our Impact

- Automated 70% of questionnaire responses using LLMs.
- Launched new enterprise-grade features like **Report Center** and **Vendor Risk Management**.
- Boosted platform reliability and reduced system latency with scalable backend patterns.

## LLM-Powered Security Reviews

I was the technical lead on integrating **large language models (LLMs)** to automatically interpret and respond to security questionnaires‚Äîone of the most time-consuming tasks for enterprise customers. I:

- Built backend services in **Node.js** and **Go**
- Collaborated with ML engineers to deploy AI pipelines
- Created intuitive frontend workflows in **React** and **TypeScript**

This reduced customer effort by 70% and accelerated sales and vendor review cycles.

## Enterprise Feature Development

I developed features tailored for Vanta's growing enterprise base, including:

- **Report Center**: a dashboard for monitoring compliance posture across frameworks
- **Vendor Risk Management**: tools to track and assess third-party risks
- **Real-time UI enhancements** for audits and controls

These features were built with GraphQL APIs, server-side orchestration, and rich client-side logic.

## Infrastructure Optimization

To handle increasing customer load and real-time data updates, I:

- Migrated services to **Kubernetes on AWS**
- Optimized job queues with **Kafka** for scalable event processing
- Reduced latency across API calls using caching and load balancing strategies

These changes improved performance, reduced downtime, and ensured platform reliability under enterprise usage.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was integrating **LLMs** into a high-trust platform‚Äîbalancing AI-generated automation with human auditability. We solved this by building review layers and fallback logic into workflows. Infrastructure scaling also required careful coordination across systems, especially when rolling out to enterprise clients with sensitive data and compliance needs.
