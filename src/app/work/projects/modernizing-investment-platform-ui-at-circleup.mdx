## Building Investor-Facing Applications

At *CircleUp*, I worked on web applications that powered the investment and discovery experience for users on the platform‚Äîhelping surface early-stage CPG companies using data and machine learning.

## The Problem

- **Performance Gaps**: Initial client-side architecture led to slow page loads and unoptimized asset delivery.
- **Fragmented UI**: Features had inconsistent interfaces and redundant frontend logic across apps.
- **SEO & Indexability**: Poor crawlability and no server-rendered content impacted marketing reach.

## My Contributions

- **React + Redux Migration**: Spearheaded a migration from legacy code to **React** and **Redux**, modernizing the UI layer across investor tools.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Built a standalone **Node.js** rendering layer to serve React components server-side, significantly improving load performance and SEO.
- **Reusable Component Library**: Designed and implemented a component library to standardize UI elements across the product surface.
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined frontend tooling and build processes, unifying JavaScript, CSS, and HTML pipelines using **Webpack**.

## Technologies Used

- **React, Redux**: UI development
- **Node.js, Express**: Server-side rendering and SSR pipeline
- **JavaScript, Webpack**: Tooling and asset management
- **HTML, CSS**: Layout and presentation

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing server-side rendering required close coordination between frontend and backend teams to ensure hydration compatibility and shared routing logic. It also introduced valuable lessons about performance budgets and the trade-offs between dynamic and pre-rendered content.

## Outcome

The replatformed investor experience resulted in:
- ‚ö° 2x faster load times for key investor workflows
- üåê Increased traffic through improved SEO
- üîÅ Greater development velocity through shared UI systems

This work helped set the foundation for scalable, data-rich interfaces at CircleUp as it grew its investor network and data science capabilities.
