## Empowering AI Coaching at Scale

At *Retorio*, I helped shape the foundation of their AI-powered coaching simulations‚Äîreal-time, personalized, and rooted in behavioral science. My contributions spanned across AI model workflows, full-stack feature implementation, and cloud infrastructure deployment to ensure high performance and adaptability.

## The Challenge: Real-Time, Personalized Coaching

Retorio‚Äôs mission to simulate human-like training demanded:
- Real-time conversation handling and voice synthesis
- Dynamic feedback based on behavioral traits
- Seamless integration of multiple AI components into a unified product experience
- Scalable backend infrastructure to support growing enterprise usage

## My Engineering Focus

I owned and implemented critical systems across the stack:
- **Frontend** in **React** for simulation UIs and dashboards
- **Backend APIs** and microservices using **Python**, **Go**, and **Node.js**
- **Cloud deployments** on **AWS** and **GCP** for high availability
- **LLM-powered agent pipelines** with **Langchain** and **GPT-4**

## Smart Coaching with AI

To create immersive and adaptive simulations, I developed:
- An intelligent **Langchain agent workflow** orchestrating multi-turn coaching sessions
- A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system backed by **vector databases** for knowledge grounding
- **BERT-based classifiers** from **Hugging Face** for sentiment and behavioral analysis
- Seamless **video generation via Synthesia** and **voiceovers using Elevenlabs**
