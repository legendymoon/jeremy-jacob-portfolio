## Building Secure Payment Systems at Scale

At *Affirm*, I spent four years engineering critical payment systems that powered the company‚Äôs rise from high-growth fintech to a public company. My work spanned backend architecture, security compliance, and large-scale infrastructure improvements.

## The Problem

- **Rising Transaction Volumes**: Affirm was scaling rapidly, requiring robust systems to handle millions of real-time transactions.
- **Strict Compliance Requirements**: As a regulated financial company, Affirm needed strong security controls and PCI compliance.
- **Complex Merchant Integrations**: Supporting a growing number of partners demanded flexible, reliable APIs.

## Our Impact

- Built microservices in **Java** and **Python** for secure payment processing.
- Designed and implemented tokenization and encryption workflows.
- Developed APIs to power real-time credit approvals and merchant experiences.

## Secure Payments and Compliance

I led initiatives to make Affirm‚Äôs systems secure and compliant:

- Implemented **PCI-compliant tokenization** for sensitive data.
- Developed access policies and SOC 2 controls across services.
- Ensured encryption standards across all transaction flows.

These efforts maintained trust as Affirm prepared for IPO.

## Scaling Infrastructure

As transaction volumes surged, I focused on scaling backend services:

- Architected microservices to improve resilience and throughput.
- Built observability dashboards with **Datadog** and centralized logging.
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines to accelerate release cycles.

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

I worked closely with frontend and product teams to deliver new merchant tools:

- Developed **React** dashboards enabling merchants to track conversion.
- Created APIs to integrate BNPL options into partner apps.
- Supported launches with major retailers.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing speed and security was a constant challenge. We invested in building rigorous testing and monitoring workflows to ensure our systems could handle scale without compromising trust.
