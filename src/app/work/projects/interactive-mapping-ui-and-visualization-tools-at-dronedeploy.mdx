## Real-Time Mapping & UI Systems

At *DroneDeploy*, I worked on building real-time drone mapping interfaces and frontend systems that supported high-resolution geospatial data visualization for industries like agriculture, energy, and construction.

## The Problem

- **Real-Time Performance**: Users needed fast, interactive map rendering for drone imagery and terrain data.
- **Complex Data Layers**: Displaying overlays like elevation, vegetation indices, and annotations required modular visualization systems.
- **Code Reuse & Velocity**: Feature development was slowed by tightly coupled UI logic and lack of shared components.

## My Contributions

- **Interactive Mapping UI**: Built modular, high-performance mapping components in **React** and **Redux**, integrating with libraries like **Mapbox** and **Leaflet**.
- **Reusable UI Systems**: Designed and implemented a set of reusable components and layout primitives to standardize dashboards and map overlays.
- **Frontend Build Overhaul**: Modernized the asset pipeline using **Webpack**, improving load times and simplifying dev workflows.
- **Geospatial Overlays**: Engineered tools for displaying drone imagery, contour lines, NDVI layers, and annotation tools in the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React, Redux**: UI and state management
- **Mapbox, Leaflet**: Geospatial rendering
- **Webpack**: Frontend tooling and optimization
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: Visualization and interface logic

## Challenges and Learnings

Delivering smooth, interactive geospatial UIs in the browser required careful handling of large data tiles, progressive rendering, and minimizing unnecessary re-renders. I learned to think in map-based abstractions and build interfaces that felt real-time while working with batch-processed drone data.

## Outcome

The platform enabled customers to interact with drone imagery in real time, annotate fields and job sites, and share insights with distributed teams. Our work helped DroneDeploy grow its enterprise footprint and win praise for usability in a traditionally complex software domain.
