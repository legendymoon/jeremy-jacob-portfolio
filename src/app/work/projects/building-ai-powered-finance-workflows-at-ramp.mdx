## Automating Finance with AI

At *Ramp*, I was a founding member of the AI technology team, focused on bringing large language models into the heart of spend management. My work enabled finance teams to automate critical workflows, reduce manual effort, and gain new insights into their operations.

## The Problem

- **Manual Expense Reviews**: Reviewing and categorizing expenses took teams hours each week.
- **Contract Complexity**: Understanding vendor agreements required manual parsing and analysis.
- **Scaling Demands**: As Ramp grew rapidly, the need for intelligent automation increased.

## Our Impact

- Built GPT-4 powered workflows that processed and categorized expenses automatically.
- Launched AI contract analysis tools to extract terms, risks, and obligations.
- Enhanced platform scalability to serve thousands of growing customers.

## AI-Powered Expense Automation

I led the development of systems that combined **Python**, **Flask**, and **GPT-4** to automate expense reviews. Key achievements:

- Integrated LLM pipelines for text extraction and categorization.
- Built frontend workflows in **React** and **TypeScript** to surface AI suggestions.
- Reduced manual expense review time by over 60%.

## Contract Intelligence Workflows

We developed tools to automatically analyze contracts and extract actionable insights:

- Developed microservices to parse and summarize contract details.
- Deployed scalable AI services on **AWS** and **GCP**.
- Enabled finance teams to identify compliance risks faster.

## Infrastructure and Scaling

To keep up with Ramp's rapid customer growth, I:

- Designed microservices architecture for AI workloads.
- Implemented observability with **Datadog dashboards** and logging pipelines.
- Optimized data pipelines for low-latency processing.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensuring **accuracy and trust in AI suggestions**. We built human review workflows, confidence scoring, and fallback logic to maintain reliability while scaling automation.
