## Reimagining Financial Experiences at Scale
At *PayPal*, I contributed to re-architecting core consumer and merchant featuresâ€”including **PayPal Savings**, **QR payments**, and **Business Debit Mastercard**â€”through scalable microservices, modern UI/UX design, and secure backend integrations.

## Revamping PayPalâ€™s Mobile Experience

Redesigned PayPalâ€™s mobile application using **React** and **React Native**, improving features such as:
- **PayPal Savings**
- **Cashback rewards**
- **Shopping tools**

The new implementation offered responsive UI and real-time feedback, resulting in improved usability, better performance, and a higher adoption rate for personal finance features.

/>

## QR Payments and Microservices at Scale

Deployed high-performance **Go** and **Node.js** microservices on **Google Cloud**, powering:
- **Zettle** integrations
- **QR payments**

We used **Kafka** for real-time event processing, **Kubernetes** for orchestration, and **Terraform** for repeatable infrastructure provisioning.

## Card Issuance & Balance Sync

Engineered workflows to handle **Business Debit Mastercard** issuance and real-time **balance synchronization**. Built using:
- **C# and Java**
- Relational databases for durable, auditable transaction processing

These flows ensured accuracy and compliance with bank-grade standards.

/>

## Real-Time Savings and Cashback Orchestration

Built orchestration systems in **Go** and **Node.js** for:
- **Savings deposit flows**
- **Cashback reward processing**

Integrated with **Synchrony Bank**, these services leveraged **Kafka** and serverless compute to meet reliability, scale, and speed targets.

## Passkey and Wallet Authentication

Developed:
- **Passkey authentication**
- **Apple Wallet card provisioning**
- **Real-time settlement webhooks**

Used **C#/.NET** and **Node.js**, deployed on **Google Cloud Kubernetes**, these security features ensured frictionless access while meeting PCI compliance.

## Technologies Used

- **React, React Native**: UI development for mobile and responsive web
- **Go, Node.js, C#, Java**: Backend services across domains
- **Kafka, PostgreSQL**: Real-time event pipelines and data management
- **Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Terraform**: Scalable infrastructure
- **Apple Wallet, Passkey, OAuth2**: Identity and provisioning frameworks

## Outcome

- ðŸ“ˆ 35% increase in daily active users for PayPal Savings
- ðŸ§¾ 50% drop in support tickets related to cashback and balance updates
- ðŸ’³ 2M+ cards issued and provisioned to Apple Wallet
- âš¡ 2x performance boost in mobile UI load times

## Challenges and Learnings

PayPalâ€™s infrastructure demanded tight integration between **real-time responsiveness**, **financial compliance**, and **multi-partner orchestration**. We solved these by designing asynchronous, modular services with thorough logging, and creating a design system that harmonized across web and native platforms.
