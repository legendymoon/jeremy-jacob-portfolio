## AI-Powered Operations for Home Services

*Build Concierge* is a UK-based startup founded by Martin Port, built to simplify the home improvement and repair industry. The platform connects homeowners with vetted professionals—enhanced by **AI-powered lead generation**, **automated payments**, and **work tracking**.

I worked across the AI, backend, and communication stack to help Build Concierge launch key automation features that power both the customer experience and operational logistics.

## The Challenge: Manual Workflows at Scale

Traditional home service platforms rely heavily on manual calls, slow quotes, and disconnected tools. Key pain points included:
- 🧾 **Delayed lead capture**: Missed or slow responses to customer inquiries led to lost business
- 💳 **Manual invoicing**: No easy way to automate payments and confirmations
- 📋 **No live job tracking**: Vendors and customers lacked visibility into field service workflows

## What I Built

I engineered core systems to automate the entire customer and operations funnel:
- Developed an **LLM-based agent using GPT-4** for 24/7 lead intake and qualification via chat, SMS, and WhatsApp
- Integrated **Twilio** for omnichannel communication and webhook-based response handling
- Built **Stripe API automations** for deposit handling, balance settlement, and digital invoicing
- Connected **BigChange APIs** to sync bookings, job status, and mobile work tracking
- Implemented **voice fallback using ElevenLabs** for agent-guided call summaries and escalations
