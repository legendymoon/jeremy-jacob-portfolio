## Final Fantasy VII Remake – Gameplay Systems & Tools

At *Square Enix*, I worked on the award-winning **Final Fantasy VII Remake**, developing high-performance gameplay systems, UI components, and automation tools that supported both Unity and proprietary engines. The goal was to create immersive gameplay experiences while maintaining efficient development workflows for a global team.

## The Problem

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Real-time 3D scenes and cinematic sequences required ultra-low latency systems and precise memory management.
- **Tooling Fragmentation**: Internal developers and artists lacked unified tooling for asset processing and engine builds.
- **Visual Fidelity**: Lighting integration and scene optimization had to meet the demanding standards of AAA production.

## My Contributions

- **Gameplay & UI Systems**: Built reusable gameplay logic and in-game UI components using **Unity with C#**, leveraging the **DOTS** and **Job System** for multithreaded performance.
- **Build Automation & Logs**: Developed backend services in **Go** for build orchestration and performance telemetry, enabling faster QA feedback loops.
- **Lighting Integration**: Integrated **Geomerics Enlighten** middleware into **Unreal Engine 4**, enhancing real-time global illumination for narrative sequences.
- **Internal Tooling**: Engineered C#/.NET and Go tools for automated asset ingestion, scene baking, and pipeline validation—reducing manual overhead for designers.
- **Cross-Engine Support**: Maintained compatibility across Unity and a proprietary Square Enix engine, ensuring consistent behavior and performance.

## Technologies Used

- **C# (Unity, .NET)**: Core gameplay, UI, tools.
- **Go**: Build automation, backend services.
- **Unreal Engine 4**: Lighting and cinematic system integration.
- **DOTS + Unity Job System**: High-performance multithreaded logic.
- **Custom CI/CD**: Integrated tools into internal pipelines for asset and build management.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working across multiple engines and platforms demanded careful attention to memory profiling and modular code design. I learned to optimize rendering paths, manage multi-platform asset flows, and enable non-technical users to operate complex tools via clean interfaces.

## Outcome

Final Fantasy VII Remake launched to critical acclaim, with particular praise for its real-time visuals and gameplay systems. Our engineering team helped support:
- Seamless cinematic transitions in gameplay
- Consistent performance on console hardware
- Efficient tooling that enabled rapid iteration by artists and level designers
