## Building the Foundation for AI-Ready Data

At *Labelbox*, I joined as one of the first engineers, leading development of the annotation interface and foundational systems. As the company scaled, I transitioned into a Staff Software Engineer role, where I helped drive product development and grow our engineering culture from the ground up.

## The Problem

- **Manual Labeling Bottlenecks**: Traditional annotation pipelines limited model iteration speed and blocked production deployment.
- **Complex AI Workflows**: Customers needed tools that could incorporate model predictions and prioritize uncertain data.
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Our systems had to support a wide range of data modalities, ontologies, and performance tiers.

## Our Impact

- Developed a **React**-based annotation UI used by thousands of annotators daily.
- Led development of **AI-assisted labeling workflows**, integrating model predictions into the annotation interface.
- Built scalable backend services in **Python** and **Node.js** to support real-time labeling queues and priority sampling.
- Enabled production-grade pipelines across images, video, text, and embeddings.

## AI-Powered Annotation Workflows

As part of our AI tooling, I:

- Integrated **model-assisted labeling**, letting teams pre-fill annotations using ML model predictions.
- Built feedback loops to flag low-confidence predictions and route them for human review.
- Designed **active learning pipelines** to surface edge cases based on uncertainty scores or embedding similarity.

This reduced labeling costs by over 50% for key customers and accelerated model iteration cycles.

## Leadership and Mentorship

As **Software Engineering Lead** and later **Staff Engineer**, I helped build Labelbox's engineering culture from the ground up:

- Mentored junior engineers, helping them ramp quickly and grow into senior roles
- Championed best practices in system design, code reviews, and product alignment
- Collaborated closely with product managers and designers to align roadmap with technical feasibility
- Played a key role in hiring and onboarding during high-growth phases
- Provided architectural guidance across teams, especially in AI/ML-integrated workflows

This leadership helped shape a high-trust, fast-moving team that delivered reliably as we scaled.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing speed and reliability was a constant challenge in our startup environment. I helped establish lightweight processes to ensure stability without sacrificing iteration. Leading by example‚Äîthrough well-scoped designs, quality-first development, and clear communication‚Äîproved key in fostering technical alignment and team confidence.

## Outcome

- ‚öôÔ∏è Reduced labeling time by 50% through AI assistance
- üìä Supported pipelines for over 100M+ labeled assets
- üåê Scaled platform to support 100+ enterprise customers in finance, healthcare, defense, and more

## Achievements & Company Milestones

- üí∞ Raised **$3.9M Seed** (2018), **$10M Series A** (2019), **$25M Series B** (2020), **$40M Series C** (2021), and **$110M Series D** (2022)
- ü¶Ñ Reached **$1B+ valuation** and over **$50M ARR**
- üèÜ Named to Forbes AI 50 and CB Insights Top 100 AI Startups

## Technologies Used

- **React, TypeScript**: Annotation UI and admin dashboards
- **Python, Node.js**: Backend services and orchestration
- **Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL**: Data pipelines and storage
- **Kubernetes, GCP**: Infrastructure scaling
- **Model-Assisted Labeling, Active Learning**: ML-driven annotation workflows

## Why Now?

As AI adoption skyrockets, the need for structured, high-quality training data is greater than ever. Labelbox pioneered the infrastructure to power this shift‚Äîand my leadership helped shape the teams and systems that made it happen.
