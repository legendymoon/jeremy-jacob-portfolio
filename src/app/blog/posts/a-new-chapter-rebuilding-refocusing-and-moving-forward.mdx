## What Happened

On June 20th, my Upwork account—where I’d built a Top Rated Plus profile and delivered 25+ high-impact projects—was compromised.

Despite every effort, the account was unrecoverable. I made the difficult decision to delete it entirely.

That platform carried years of work. Countless hours of code, conversation, launches, and lessons. Some of my favorite AI systems were born there: a voice agent for a fintech platform, a digital twin for a creator, a coaching simulation tool used across global teams.

It hurt. But sometimes, the path forward *isn't* about restoration.

It’s about **redefinition**.

## What I’m Taking With Me

Losing a profile didn’t erase the work I’ve done—or the relationships I built through it.

- I still carry the **LLM systems I architected** from scratch: GPT-4 pipelines, LangChain agents, retrieval systems with real-world grounding.
- I still carry the experience of **collaborating across time zones**, cultures, and product teams—in finance, real estate, healthcare, and retail.
- I still carry the discipline of **shipping, not just showcasing**—from fuzzy ideas to deployed, scalable systems.

And maybe most importantly, I carry **clarity**. About what matters now.

## What I Want More Of

This chapter isn’t about going back—it’s about **doubling down**.

- I want more projects where **AI makes something better**, not just more impressive.
- I want to partner with **founders or product leads** who see LLMs as part of a system—not just a feature.
- I want ownership—not in title, but in responsibility. In product sense. In impact.

Whether that's direct contract, contract-to-hire, or small startup work—I’m open. What matters most is **trust, momentum, and purpose**.

## What I Bring

- 6+ years of full-stack experience across real-time systems, fintech, and automation  
- Deep specialization in **LLMs and agent workflows** using GPT-4, LangChain, RAG, and multimodal AI  
- Frontend fluency with React, backend services in Go, Python, Node.js  
- Cloud-native deployment with AWS, GCP, and modern DevOps  
- A track record of **fast onboarding, thoughtful scoping, and low-friction delivery**

More than anything, I bring **a founder’s mindset with an engineer’s execution**.

## What I’m Leaving Behind

I'm leaving behind:

- The illusion of safety in platforms you don't control  
- The need for badges to prove value  
- The idea that reputation can only live inside someone else's dashboard

I’m not bitter. I’m *awake*.

What I lost was structure. What I kept was substance.

## If You're Reading This...

If you're a founder who needs a sharp AI engineer to build from zero...  
If you're a product owner looking to move from prototype to production...  
If you're building something worth caring about...

I’m open. Ready. Re-centered.

This isn’t the end of something. It’s the start of something better.

Let’s talk.
