## Introduction

Monitoring is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. Whether you're scaling microservices or debugging production outages, observability provides the visibility you need to keep systems healthy.

In this post, we’ll walk through how to monitor Go services using **OpenTelemetry** for instrumentation and **Grafana** for visualization.

## Why OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) (OTel) is an open-source observability framework that provides standardized APIs and SDKs for **traces**, **metrics**, and **logs**. It helps you avoid vendor lock-in and offers deep integration with popular backends.

## Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Packages

In your Go project, install the required packages:

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code:
        `go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel
         go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace
         go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp`,
      language: "bash",
      label: "Terminal"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Step 2: Configure the Tracer

Set up a tracer that exports spans via OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) to Grafana Agent or another collector:

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code:
      `package main

      import (
        "context"
        "log"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp"
      )

      func initTracer(ctx context.Context) func() {
        exporter, err := otlptracehttp.New(ctx)
        if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
        }

        tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(trace.WithBatcher(exporter))
        otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)

        return func() {
          _ = tp.Shutdown(ctx)
        }
      }`,
      language: "go",
      label: "main.go"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Step 3: Instrument Your Code

Use the tracer to start spans for key operations:

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code:
      `func HandleRequest(ctx context.Context) {
        tracer := otel.Tracer("my-service")
        ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "HandleRequest")
        defer span.End()

        // Your business logic here
      }`,
      language: "go",
      label: "handlers/request.go"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Step 4: Set Up Grafana

You can send traces to:

- **Grafana Cloud**
- **Grafana Agent** (on-prem)
- **Tempo** (distributed tracing backend)

Once connected, Grafana's Explore tab will show spans like this:

<Carousel
  images={[{ src: "/images/blog/tech-monitoring-go-opentelemetry-grafana/span-tree.png", alt: "Trace view in Grafana Tempo" }]}
/>

To view metrics and logs, you can also configure:

- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Loki** for logs

## Benefits of This Setup

✅ **Unified Observability**  
Traces, metrics, and logs all tied together for complete context.

✅ **Vendor-Neutral**  
Switch backends anytime—Prometheus, Tempo, Jaeger, etc.

✅ **Lightweight Instrumentation**  
OTel has minimal overhead and great community support.

## Conclusion

By integrating OpenTelemetry with Go and visualizing it through Grafana, you unlock powerful insights into your services. Whether it's performance bottlenecks, error tracing, or latency spikes, you'll be ready with real-time visibility.

Start simple, and layer in complexity as your system grows. Your future self will thank you.
