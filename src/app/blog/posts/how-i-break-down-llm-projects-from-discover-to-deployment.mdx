## The Problem With Most AI Builds

Everyone wants to “use AI” right now—but the path from idea to outcome isn’t always clear.

I’ve worked with clients across industries—real estate, fintech, healthcare, retail, and creator platforms—and no matter how different the product is, the process of building with LLMs follows a surprisingly repeatable shape.

In this post, I’ll show you how I break down LLM projects—**from messy input to production-grade agent**—in a way that’s fast, modular, and focused on what matters.

## 1. Discovery: Aligning on What the AI Should Actually Do

This is where most projects fall apart before they even start.

Clients often ask:  
> “Can we use GPT-4 to answer user questions?”  
> “Can we summarize long docs automatically?”

These are good instincts—but not yet scoped work.

So I help clarify:
- Who is the end user?
- What information do they need that they don’t already have?
- What should the AI do vs. what should the interface or backend handle?

Outcome: **a defined user-action loop**, not just a prompt idea.

## 2. Data Grounding: What Does the AI Need to Know?

LLMs like GPT-4 don’t know anything about *you* by default.

So we define:
- What documents, data, or context does the model need?
- Does that data change often (e.g. product inventory) or rarely (e.g. company policies)?
- Does the output need citations or explainability?

If yes, we plan for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** early.

## 3. Architecture Planning: Agent or Function?

I decide early on:
- Should we use **plain completion** (1-turn prompt)?
- Or a **LangChain agent** with tool usage and memory?
- Do we need streaming, vision, voice, or multilingual output?

I diagram the flow:
- Inputs → Preprocessing → Prompt strategy → Output handling → Post-processing or API chaining

I choose tools like:
- **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **Haystack** (agent logic)
- **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, **Qdrant** (vector DBs)
- **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **open-source models** (LLMs)

Outcome: A scoped, testable LLM pipeline that works in modular layers.

## 4. Prototyping: Build Small, Test Fast

The first thing I ship is **not a full app**.

It’s usually a backend route + minimal UI (or console) to validate:
- Is the model returning what we expect?
- Are the retrievals accurate?
- Are users confused or surprised by the output?

This helps clients give real feedback before we spend time on polish or infra.

## 5. Feedback Loops: Logging + Learning

Before going live, I build in:
- **LLM logs** (prompt, input, output, latency, errors)
- **User rating capture** (was this helpful?)
- **Fallbacks** (e.g. rule-based logic if model fails or stalls)

Why? Because LLM systems don’t just ship once—they evolve. I give clients the tools to tune and adapt over time.

## 6. Deployment: Real Infra, Real Access Control

When it’s time to go live, I deploy with:
- **Serverless backend** (e.g. AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions)
- **Rate-limiting + auth** for model endpoints
- **Admin dashboards** to tweak temperature, token limits, prompt templates
- **Multi-region deployments** if needed for latency or compliance

## Tools I Commonly Use

- **LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude, Mixtral, LLaMA 3  
- **Orchestration**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom agents  
- **Embedding + RAG**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Supabase vector  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (FastAPI), Go  
- **Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Vercel, AWS

## Why This Works

AI isn’t magic. It’s just another form of interface—with its own failure modes and architecture constraints.

By breaking LLM projects into **user needs → data flow → system behavior → deployment**, I help clients move faster, avoid dead ends, and build systems that actually serve their customers.

If you're thinking about launching your own AI feature or product, let’s start with the right question—not the fanciest model.
