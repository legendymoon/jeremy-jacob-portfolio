## The Comfortable Path

I started my career at Affirm—one of the most recognized names in Buy Now, Pay Later. Fresh out of the University of Michigan, I was excited to work on secure payment systems and learn what it meant to build software trusted by millions of people.

And I did. I spent years scaling backend infrastructure, building microservices, and designing systems that kept transactions flowing smoothly. I learned how to write reliable code, how to think in compliance frameworks, and how to work in a world where trust was everything.

But over time, something felt missing. Even as Affirm grew rapidly and went public, I noticed how each decision moved just a bit slower. The systems were strong, but change was incremental.

## Wanting More Ownership and Velocity

I wasn’t burned out. But I was ready for something different.

I wanted to move faster. To build products end to end. To be closer to the customer and the core of the business. I didn’t want to just maintain reliable infrastructure—I wanted to shape the future of it.

So I left the familiarity of Affirm’s enterprise systems and joined Ramp, a startup with big ambitions.

Everything shifted overnight.

## From Scale to Speed

At Ramp, the contrast was immediate:

- I was leading development of AI-powered workflows in my first few months.
- There were fewer layers—every engineer had a voice in architecture.
- Product and engineering were inseparable.
- Mistakes were visible. Impact was, too.

I helped build GPT-4 integrations that automated expense processing and contract analysis—features that redefined how finance teams work. In less than a year, I learned more about AI, cloud scaling, and startup culture than I thought possible.

## Why It Was Worth It

It’s not that Affirm was lacking—it gave me invaluable experience in security, scale, and rigor.

But Ramp offered what I needed next:

- Speed that demanded decisive action.
- Ownership over features that shaped the roadmap.
- A culture that rewarded experimentation.

That combination of urgency and autonomy was exactly what I was looking for.

## Looking Back

Affirm taught me how to build systems that don’t break, even when millions depend on them.

But it was Ramp that challenged me to think bigger—to push boundaries with AI, move faster, and embrace the discomfort that comes with growth.

## Final Thoughts

Would I trade my time at Affirm? Not a chance.

Would I go back? Only if it started operating like a startup again.

Velocity isn’t just about how quickly you ship—it’s about the alignment between effort and impact. That’s why I made the jump. And that’s why I still build like it’s day one, even now.
