## The Shift

For years, I worked inside some of the most exciting tech teams—Boston Dynamics, PayPal, and global product orgs pushing millions of events through real-time systems.

But in 2022, I pivoted. I left the comfort of full-time roles to build a freelance practice focused on **AI**, **LLMs**, and **automation**. Since then, I’ve shipped 25+ projects as a Top Rated Plus freelancer, working with startups, global brands, and technical founders alike.

And here's the honest answer to *why*: **I wanted to stop optimizing for promotion—and start optimizing for impact.**

## What I Wanted More Of

I didn’t leave because I burned out—I left because I wanted more:

- **More skin in the game.** I wanted to work directly with decision-makers, not around layers of sign-off.
- **More variety.** I thrive when I can solve different kinds of problems—LLM agents one week, fintech orchestration the next.
- **More growth.** I wanted to rapidly deepen my expertise in AI—hands-on with GPT-4, LangChain, RAG, voice synthesis, vector search—not someday, but now.
- **More focus.** Without meetings and sprint theater, I spend most of my time building, testing, refining.
- **More human connection.** Every client I work with now is someone I chose to partner with—not someone assigned.

Freelancing has given me all of that, plus something I didn’t expect: clarity.

## What Clients Get From Me

This wasn’t a leap into the unknown. It was a transition into a new kind of engineering—one that's faster, leaner, and aligned.

Today, when a company hires me, they’re not getting a team of 5. They're getting **one person who knows how to ship full systems**, architect LLM workflows, scale secure infra, and ask the right product questions. I’ve done it across finance, real estate, healthcare, and entertainment.

And because I'm independent, I don’t bring overhead—I bring **ownership**.

## The Stack I Work With

- **AI/LLMs**: GPT-4, LangChain, Hugging Face, RAG, agents  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Go, Python, PostgreSQL  
- **Infra**: AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- **Comms**: Twilio, ElevenLabs, Vapi  
- **Payments**: Stripe, Plaid  
- **Clients**: reAlpha, MAF, Aviary, Retorio, Build Concierge, Avori Henderson

And yes—I do it all hands-on. No subcontractors. Just deep focus and fast feedback loops.

## What I’ve Learned

Freelancing isn’t about being a lone wolf—it’s about being *surgically useful*. I’ve learned how to:

- Jump into unknown codebases and deliver fast  
- Guide clients through LLM integration without buzzwords  
- Turn vague goals into ship-ready scope  
- Balance autonomy with collaboration

And maybe most importantly: I’ve learned how to deliver value, not just code.

## Why Now?

AI is moving fast. Clients don’t need more generalists or teams that take three weeks to decide on stack. They need focused builders who know how to **navigate complexity, ship fast, and make it real**.

That's what I do. Freelance isn’t a side hustle for me—it’s the framework I chose to deliver sharper work, on my terms, with clients who care.

If that sounds like someone you want in your corner, let’s talk.
