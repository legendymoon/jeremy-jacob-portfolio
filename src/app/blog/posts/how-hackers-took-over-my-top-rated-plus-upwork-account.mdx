## The Day Everything Changed

I’ve freelanced for years.  
I worked hard to earn **Top Rated Plus** status on Upwork—delivering reliable, high-quality work to clients around the world.

But none of that mattered the day my account was hacked.

One morning, I woke up to find I was locked out. My email had been changed. My security questions reset. The hackers started messaging clients—pretending to be me—and tried to withdraw funds and accept new contracts.

Despite having every badge of trust the platform offered, my account was no longer under my control.

## How It Happened

Like many professionals, I assumed that 2FA and a strong password were enough. But attackers used a combination of:

- **Phishing emails** disguised as Upwork notifications.
- Social engineering to reset recovery options.
- Exploiting gaps in platform verification.

By the time I realized what was happening, they already had access.

Upwork support eventually responded—but not quickly enough to prevent confusion, potential damage to my reputation, and hours of lost work.

## Why I’m Connecting Outside the Platform

If you’ve come across my profile—or received a message from someone claiming to be me—please be cautious.

This experience taught me a simple truth:

> **Badges don’t guarantee authenticity.**

Just because an account says **Top Rated Plus** doesn’t mean it’s safe. Credentials can be stolen, and trust symbols can be abused.

That’s why I’m now:

- Connecting with clients **directly** via email.
- Verifying all communication channels independently.
- Encouraging prospective clients to schedule video calls and confirm my identity before engaging.

## How to Protect Yourself

If you’re hiring freelancers or working on Upwork, here are a few lessons I wish I’d known sooner:

- **Never rely solely on platform badges.**
- Always confirm identity via multiple channels (e.g., a live call).
- Use unique, platform-specific passwords.
- Enable 2FA—but remember it’s not foolproof.
- Be cautious of urgent requests, unexpected invoices, or payment redirects.

## Final Thoughts

Having your professional reputation hijacked is frustrating and unsettling. But transparency matters. That’s why I’m sharing this story openly.

If you’ve worked with me before—or are thinking about working with me—please feel free to:

- Reach out directly via my verified email or website.
- Schedule a call to confirm it’s really me.
- Ask questions. I’m always happy to prove legitimacy.

Badges are easy to fake.  
Consistency and real relationships aren’t.

Thanks for taking the time to read—and stay safe out there.
