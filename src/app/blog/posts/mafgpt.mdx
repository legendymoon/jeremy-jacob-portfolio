## When Dubai Meets Remote Dev: Context

In 2024, I was brought in to help engineer **MAFGPT**—a secure, multilingual AI assistant for **Majid Al Futtaim**, one of the Middle East’s largest retail and real estate groups.

The goal?  
To build an internal version of ChatGPT that employees and clients could use—**grounded in company data, hosted in private cloud, and aligned with UAE regulatory standards.**

I wasn’t in Dubai. But I was fully embedded—collaborating with developers in Abu Dhabi, project leads in Cairo, and DevOps stakeholders in Riyadh.

And across language, time zones, and architecture preferences, we made it work.

## 1. Timezones Are a Constraint—but Also a Rhythm

The UAE is 8–9 hours ahead of me. So we built a rhythm:

- **Mornings** were async handoffs. I’d wake up to Slack threads, GitHub PRs, and Loom reviews.
- **Late evenings** became my window for real-time syncs—usually once or twice a week.
- We kept a **shared Notion board** for decisions, risks, and design diagrams—no one ever started the day guessing.

This rhythm helped us move faster, not slower. Because every message had to be intentional.

## 2. Technical Alignment Started With Vocabulary

When I said “vector DB,” someone said “Pinecone or Weaviate?”  
When I said “tooling agent,” someone said “LangChain or LlamaIndex?”

That kind of alignment doesn’t happen by default.

So in our first 2 days, I:
- Documented the intended AI architecture in both **visual flowcharts** and plain language
- Called out optional vs. required modules (e.g. prompt versioning, doc ingestion, session memory)
- Opened the door to architecture debates early—and absorbed local team preferences

This earned respect. And it let us move quickly without turf battles.

## 3. Language Wasn’t a Barrier—But Precision Mattered

English was the working language. But tone and interpretation still mattered.

- When I said “Could we revisit this approach?” I made sure it didn’t sound like critique.
- When someone said “Let me check with compliance,” I respected the unspoken delay.

In cross-cultural teams, **empathy is efficiency.** You don’t bulldoze to clarity—you build toward it.

## 4. Respecting Regional Context Made the Product Better

MAF wasn’t building a Silicon Valley chatbot.

They were building:
- An internal assistant that had to operate in **Arabic and English**
- A cloud-hosted model that needed to **pass UAE security review**
- A UI that needed to work on mobile-first retail networks

Every decision had regional nuance.

I didn’t just write code—I asked questions like:
> “How do users usually file support requests here?”  
> “What’s the SLA expectation for retail ops in Sharjah?”  
> “What data can we safely cache without raising flags?”

## 5. The Result? A Seamless Launch, Trusted AI, and Real Momentum

Together, we shipped:
- A secure, role-aware AI assistant for 10,000+ employees  
- Grounded answers using MAF’s internal documentation and SOPs  
- Admin tooling to manage prompts, review logs, and tune access levels  
- Arabic + English support from day one

And perhaps most importantly—we built **trust**. Across oceans. Across timezones. Across cultures.

## What I Took Away

This project taught me a lot about:
- Navigating ambiguity with grace  
- Building alignment through communication, not control  
- Designing products that *respect where they live*  

Clients in the UAE, Europe, or the US—what they all really want is **clarity, ownership, and momentum**.

That’s what I bring. No matter where you are.
