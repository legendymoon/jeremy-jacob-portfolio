## Introduction

Logging is critical for understanding application behavior, debugging issues, and monitoring performance. With Go 1.21, structured logging became even more straightforward and powerful through the built-in `slog` package.

Let's explore how you can implement structured logging effectively in your Go applications.

## Getting Started with slog

Go’s `slog` offers built-in support for structured logs, providing readable and easily parsable log outputs. Here’s how you start with basic structured logging:

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`package main

import (
    "log/slog"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
    logger.Info("Application started", "version", "1.0.0")
}`,
        language: "go",
        label: "cmd/main.go"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Logging Structured Data

With structured logging, contextual data becomes clear and organized. Here’s how you can log structured events effectively:

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`func processOrder(orderID string, amount float64) {
    slog.Info("Processing order",
        "orderID", orderID,
        "amount", amount,
        "status", "initiated",
    )
}`,
        language: "go",
        label: "internal/orders/process.go"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Advantages of Using Go's slog

### 1. Enhanced Readability and Parsing
Logs are structured, making it easy to search, filter, and analyze in monitoring systems like Elasticsearch or Loki.

### 2. Simplified Debugging
Structured logs provide precise context, significantly easing debugging and issue resolution.

## Customizing Log Levels and Formatting

Customize log levels and formatting to suit your application needs. Here's an example:

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`package main

import (
    "log/slog"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    handler := slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
        Level: slog.LevelDebug,
    })
    logger := slog.New(handler)

    logger.Debug("Debugging application start", "env", "development")
}`,
        language: "go",
        label: "cmd/custom_log_levels.go"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Practical Example: Middleware Logging in Web Applications

Here's how structured logging can enhance clarity when used as middleware in web frameworks:

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`func LoggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        slog.Info("Incoming request",
            "method", r.Method,
            "path", r.URL.Path,
            "remote_addr", r.RemoteAddr,
        )
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}`,
        language: "go",
        label: "internal/middleware/logging.go"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

Go's built-in `slog` package simplifies structured logging significantly, enhancing your application's logs clarity and maintainability. Integrate structured logging with `slog` into your Go projects to streamline debugging and monitoring effectively.
