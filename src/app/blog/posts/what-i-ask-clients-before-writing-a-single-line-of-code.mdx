title: "What I Ask Clients Before Writing a Single Line of Code"
summary: "Good engineering starts with better questions. Here's how I help clients clarify their vision, align on outcomes, and avoid building the wrong thing—before any code is written."

## The Premise

Most failed projects don’t die because of bad code.

They fail because no one asked the right questions at the start.

Over the last few years as a freelance engineer, I’ve worked with dozens of clients—from real estate platforms to voice AI systems to creator tools. Some came with a product spec. Some came with an idea on a napkin. All of them wanted something real.

Before I write any code, I run through a short, structured set of questions. These don’t just help me scope—they help the **client get clearer on what they actually want to build**.

## 1. What is the core outcome this product or feature needs to deliver?

I start with this—not “what features do you want,” but “what change do you want to see?”

Is it faster onboarding? Fewer support tickets? Higher retention? A working MVP to raise funding?

A clear outcome keeps us honest. It becomes the North Star I use to evaluate scope, tech choices, and even whether we should build at all.

## 2. Who is going to use this—and what do they know, fear, or expect?

Especially in AI projects, this matters a lot.

Are we serving:
- A customer success team that wants clarity?
- An end-user who just wants speed?
- A regulator who needs auditability?

LLMs can hallucinate, APIs can be delayed, and real-world users don’t care about the model architecture. They care about outcomes, language, latency, and trust. I map those needs early.

## 3. What are the known constraints—technical, legal, or emotional?

Sometimes a client tells me, “We have to use Azure OpenAI because of compliance.”  
Other times it’s, “Our CTO really doesn’t want another Python service.”

These are important to know. Good systems respect **reality**, not just architecture diagrams. Constraints help me focus—not fight upstream.

## 4. If this works, what happens next?

This is about **trajectory**.

Do we need to scale this to 1M users?  
Is it a testbed for a larger enterprise client?  
Will it be demoed to investors in 3 weeks?

Knowing what’s next helps me build the *right kind of first version*—not just something that works, but something that can evolve.

## 5. What not to build?

This is one of my favorite questions.

Most projects have assumptions baked in: "We should support file uploads," or "We need user auth on day one."

Sometimes they’re right. Often they’re not. I help clients subtract scope they don’t need—so they can move faster, test earlier, and spend budget on what actually drives impact.

## Bonus: What does success feel like?

Sometimes, especially with solo founders or creators, I ask a softer question:

> “Imagine it’s live. You just showed it to your audience. What’s the reaction you’re hoping for?”

Answers like:
- “That’s exactly what I needed.”
- “Wow, it just works.”
- “I didn’t think we could do that without hiring a whole team.”

These emotional cues help me write better copy, shape better flows, and guide smarter defaults.

## Why This Matters

I don’t start with code because I’m lazy. I start with questions because it’s faster.

The more clarity we have before we touch the keyboard, the less time we spend rebuilding, rewriting, or wondering why no one’s using the thing we shipped.

This is how I help my clients **build what matters**—not just what fits into a sprint board.

If you're considering building something with AI, automation, or just a new idea—you don’t need a developer yet. You need the *right questions*. And I’ll bring those first.
