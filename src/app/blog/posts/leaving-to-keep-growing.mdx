## Chapter One: Growing with Labelbox

I joined **Labelbox in 2018**, just as it was getting started. One of the earliest engineers on the team, I had the rare opportunity to help build not just a product, but a culture.

From day one, it was more than a job—it was a mission. We were figuring things out together, shipping fast, and solving real problems in data labeling and ML workflows. I helped lead the development of backend systems, scaling pipelines, and the open-source Python SDK used by our customers and partners.

But what mattered even more than the code was the **shared experience**.

We celebrated fundraising milestones and product launches. We stayed late during tough releases. We welcomed new teammates and said goodbye to others. Over the years, we laughed, stressed, shipped, and leveled up **together**.

## Chapter Two: Recognized, and Then Reflective

Thanks to the support and belief of my teammates, I was promoted from **Software Engineering Lead to Staff Software Engineer**—a milestone I was incredibly proud of.

And yet, I started to ask myself something quietly:

> *What else can I do for this team—this company I care about so much?*

The truth is: I still had ideas. Still had energy. But I also saw that **we had a strong, skilled, and growing engineering team**. New leaders were rising. And maybe—just maybe—it was time for me to step aside and make space for others.

At the same time, I realized **I needed a new type of growth**—not just more responsibility, but fresh context, unfamiliar problems, and a different kind of discomfort.

That realization didn’t come quickly. But when it did, it came with clarity.

## Chapter Three: Choosing Vanta

That’s what led me to **Vanta**.

Yes, I joined as a **Senior Software Engineer**—not Staff. But that wasn’t the point. What mattered was that I’d be:

- Working on **security and compliance automation**, an entirely new and important domain.
- Helping integrate **LLMs into real workflows**, pushing the edge of modern AI tooling.
- Building in **Go, Node.js, and GraphQL** on a lean team shipping fast.

Vanta gave me what I needed: a reset. A chance to **be uncomfortable again**, to learn again, to build with urgency again.

And even in the unfamiliar, I carried everything Labelbox taught me: ownership, clarity, mentorship, and heart.

## Final Thoughts

Leaving Labelbox was one of the hardest decisions of my career.

I didn’t leave because something was missing. I left because I had been **given so much**—and wanted to keep earning it by **continuing to grow**, even if that meant letting go.

To everyone at Labelbox: thank you for the chapter. To Vanta: thank you for the next one.
