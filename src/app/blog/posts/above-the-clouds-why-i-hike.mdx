## My Trailhead

I don't remember my first hike. But I remember the first time I realized why I keep hiking.

It was a foggy morning in Marin County. The trail started steep and silent, the air thick with dew and eucalyptus. With each switchback, the chatter of the world faded. At the summit, just as the sun broke through the mist, I stood above the clouds—completely alone, but more connected than ever.

That moment changed something. It turned hiking into a ritual.

## Why I Hike

I hike to **disconnect from noise and reconnect with self**.

In tech, we operate in constant mental motion—notifications, commits, deadlines, meetings. But on a trail, none of that matters. It's just breath, heartbeat, and ground. The trail doesn't care about velocity. It only asks you to keep going.

I hike because **solitude sharpens my thinking**. Some of my best ideas—architecture choices, product pivots, even blog topics—came to me somewhere between mile 3 and mile 10. There's something about sustained physical effort that unlocks mental flow. 

I hike because **nature humbles me**. Staring down a valley carved by time or watching a hawk glide thermals reminds me how small (and lucky) I am. It's a quiet reset. A zoom-out.

## The Ritual

For the past few years, I've built hiking into my routine. Here's what it looks like:

- **Friday night**: I check the trail conditions and pack my gear.
- **Saturday early morning**: Coffee, drive, trailhead by sunrise.
- **3–10 miles**, depending on terrain and time.
- No music. Just footsteps, wind, and the occasional squirrel sprint.

Sometimes I go with friends. But my favorite hikes are solo. It's not about speed or stats—it's about space. Mentally, emotionally, spiritually.

## The Tech-Hiking Connection

Funny enough, hiking has made me a better engineer.

- I've learned to **respect constraints**—just like a trail, a well-built system has boundaries for a reason.
- I've embraced **iteration**—switchbacks exist for a purpose. So do refactors.
- I've valued **pacing**—there's no glory in burning out halfway up the mountain.

Most importantly, I've learned that **perspective matters**. Sometimes you don't need to solve the problem. You just need to step away and breathe.

## Parting Thoughts

I don't hike for the photos or the stats (though the views don't hurt). I hike because it grounds me. It makes me feel alive, awake, and anchored. Above the clouds, I remember who I am—and what matters.

If you've never tried a solo hike, I recommend it. Not just for your legs, but for your mind. You might be surprised by what you hear when everything else goes quiet.
