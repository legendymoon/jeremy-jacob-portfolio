## A Master in the Arena

In a distant kingdom, there was a man known across the land as the **Legendary Fighting Master**.

He never ruled a city. Never led an army.

Yet, beneath his guidance, **kings were born**. **Generals were shaped**. **Legends were trained**.

He taught them everything: the precision of combat, the patience of planning, the strength of mind, and even his own rare form of battlefield magic.

But the strangest part?

He never stepped beyond the arena.  
He never sought the crown.  
He never took the battlefield for himself.

## A Simple Question

One day, a young trainee asked him:

> "Master, if you’re stronger than kings and wiser than generals, why don’t you go become one?"

/>


The master smiled—calm, patient, proud—and said:

> “Because my happiness lies not in ruling—but in raising rulers.”

> “My joy is in shaping those who will surpass me.”

> “When my students rise to greatness, that is my greatest triumph.”

## Why I Left a Company I Loved

That story has stayed with me—because it mirrors my own journey.

In 2019, I joined **Affirm** as an early-career engineer, eager to learn how secure financial systems were built. Over time, I grew into a **Senior Software Engineer**, designing payment flows, scaling infrastructure, and helping Affirm mature into a public company trusted by millions.

I learned what it meant to build with discipline and clarity.  
I learned how to mentor newer engineers and guide complex projects.  
And I learned that reliability isn’t just a feature—it’s a promise you make to your customers.

Eventually, I realized I had given everything I could in that arena.  
I had helped build strong systems—and stronger teammates.

So when the question came—what’s next?  
The answer wasn’t “more of the same.”  
It was: **find a new frontier**.

## Knowing When to Leave

Like the master in the story, I believe:

- There comes a time when your growth requires new challenges.
- When you’ve helped build something resilient, it’s okay to trust others to carry it forward.
- And when the moment arrives, the most respectful thing you can do… is step aside and start again.

So I did.

With gratitude. With pride. With respect for everything we built together.

## Starting Over at Ramp

I joined **Ramp** as a **Senior Software Engineer**—not for a title change, but for a chance to help build in a different way.

- A chance to work at startup speed.  
- To pioneer AI-powered workflows that reimagined financial operations.  
- To help create a culture where engineers could move fast, own outcomes, and grow together.

I’m not done building. I’m not done learning.  
But I believe in choosing the next arena with intention—and rising to meet it.

## Final Thoughts

There are many paths in a career.  
Some seek titles. Some chase empires.  
And some—quietly, deliberately—choose **legacy**.

If you’re someone who finds joy in others’ growth…  
If you’ve ever left something great to help build something new…  
Then maybe you’re a master, too.
