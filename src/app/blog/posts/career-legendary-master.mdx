## A Master in the Arena

In a distant kingdom, there was a man known across the land as the **Legendary Fighting Master**.

He never ruled a city. Never led an army.

Yet, beneath his guidance, **kings were born**. **Generals were shaped**. **Legends were trained**.

He taught them everything: the precision of combat, the patience of planning, the strength of mind, and even his own rare form of battlefield magic.

But the strangest part?

He never stepped beyond the arena.  
He never sought the crown.  
He never took the battlefield for himself.

## A Simple Question

One day, a young trainee asked him:

> "Master, if you’re stronger than kings and wiser than generals, why don’t you go become one?"

/>


The master smiled—calm, patient, proud—and said:

> “Because my happiness lies not in ruling—but in raising rulers.”

> “My joy is in shaping those who will surpass me.”

> “When my students rise to greatness, that is my greatest triumph.”

## Why I Left a Company I Loved

That story has stayed with me—because it mirrors my own journey.

In 2018, I joined **Labelbox** in its earliest days. We were small. Scrappy. Full of questions and infinite energy.

Over time, I helped build systems, teams, SDKs, and dreams.  
I saw it grow. I grew with it.

Together, we raised funding. Built pipelines. Shipped fast.  
And most of all—we **trained warriors**. Engineers, PMs, leaders.

Eventually, I was promoted to **Staff Software Engineer**.  
But more importantly—I had helped **build a generation of builders**.

So when the question came—what’s next?  
The answer wasn’t “more of the same.”  
It was: **find the next arena**.

## Knowing When to Leave

Like the master in the story, I believe:

- There comes a time when students no longer need you.
- There’s nothing more to teach—only space to let them lead.
- And when that moment arrives, the most generous thing you can do… is leave.

So I did.

With love. With pride. With respect for the team I helped grow.

## Starting Over at Vanta

I joined **Vanta** as a **Senior Software Engineer**—not for a title bump, but for something deeper.

- A chance to build again.  
- A team hungry to learn.  
- A new battlefield where the next generation of leaders would emerge.

I’m not done teaching. I’m not done building.  
But I believe in leaving when the timing is right—and returning to the arena when the challenge is worthy.

## Final Thoughts

There are many paths in a career.  
Some seek titles. Some chase empires.  
And some—quietly, deliberately—choose **legacy**.

If you’re someone who finds joy in others’ growth…  
If you’ve ever left something great to help build something new…  
Then maybe you’re a master, too.
