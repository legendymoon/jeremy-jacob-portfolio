## Meet My Coworker

He doesn't write code. He doesn't review PRs. He barks during standups and sleeps through retros. But somehow, he's the most consistent presence in my work life.

My dog—part Labrador, part mystery—is the kind of coworker every remote engineer needs. He's calm under pressure, enthusiastic about every break, and always down for a walk-and-talk.

He also has a sharp nose for when I’m spiraling into a bug I shouldn’t be obsessing over.

## Remote Work, Real Companionship

Working remotely has its perks, but it can also feel isolating. Long blocks of silent concentration, back-to-back Zooms, days where you don’t interact with another human in person. 

Enter: four legs, one tail, and a quiet ability to make even the hardest days feel lighter.

When I'm heads down in debugging mode or mentally drained after a sprint review, he reminds me to step outside, get some sun, and chase something that isn't a deadline. Even just hearing paws on the floor keeps me grounded.

## Code, Walk, Repeat

We've built a routine. Mornings start with coffee and a walk—no Slack, no screens. Just sidewalk and sky.

He lies next to me as I code, occasionally sighing with dramatic effect if I forget to take a break. If I’m stuck on a bug for too long, he’ll literally nudge me to step away. It’s uncanny.

Our mid-day walk? That's when I think through architecture problems. Walking helps me untangle systems. He just sniffs trees. But somehow, by the time we’re back, I have answers.

## Life Lessons from a Dog

He doesn’t care about my title. He doesn’t know what Kubernetes is. But he *does* understand:

- **Presence**: He lives in the now—no stress about the next ticket.
- **Consistency**: Same wag, every day, no matter what happened at work.
- **Boundaries**: When it’s time to rest, he *actually* rests. (Unlike some engineers.)

There’s a lot dogs teach us that productivity gurus don’t. And in a world full of optimization, sometimes it’s okay to just lie on the floor and breathe for a minute.

## The Office MVP

I used to think of him as background noise in my workflow. Now I realize—he *is* the workflow.

He helps me unplug. He helps me show up. And when the day ends and I close the laptop, he’s the one who makes it all feel okay, no matter how many PRs got merged or left hanging.

He’s not just a pet.

He’s my emotional support engineer.
