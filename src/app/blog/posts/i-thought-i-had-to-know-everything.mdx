## The Pressure to Know

When I started my first engineering job, I walked into the office every day pretending I was someone else.

Someone confident.  
Someone brilliant.  
Someone who didn't need to check Stack Overflow five times before lunch.

I believed—quietly but deeply—that my value came from how much I knew. That *real engineers* didn't get stuck. That asking for help was weakness dressed as curiosity.

## The Silent Fear

The fear wasn't loud. It didn't come from my team or manager. It came from inside — this creeping sense that I was always one question away from being exposed.

So I studied. I read source code I didn't understand. I over-prepared for sprint planning. I'd rather pull an all-nighter than admit I didn't get the task. Somewhere along the way, I began to confuse *mastery* with *worth*.

## The Moment It Broke

It was a senior backend engineer who broke the illusion — gently.

One day during a code review, I made a comment about something in their pull request. It was wrong. Not maliciously wrong — just a misunderstanding. I half-expected a slap on the wrist.

But they paused, smiled, and said:  
> "Ah, I didn't think of that. Let's double-check it together.”

That moment cracked the myth.  
They weren't pretending. They weren't defensive.  
They were just… comfortable *not knowing* everything.

It made me rethink everything I thought being "senior” meant.

## What Changed After That

I started asking better questions. I started pairing more often.  
I started saying "I don't know” out loud — and nobody flinched.

In fact, the more I admitted what I didn't know, the more people trusted me. Because honesty is magnetic. And learning out loud invites others to do the same.

The imposter syndrome didn't vanish, but it softened. It turned into something more useful: humility with momentum.

## If You're Early in Your Journey

You don't have to know everything. You're not supposed to.  
Your job isn't to be a database of answers — it's to be a reliable node in a network of learning.

The best engineers I know aren't the ones with perfect recall.  
They're the ones who know how to move forward, *together*.
