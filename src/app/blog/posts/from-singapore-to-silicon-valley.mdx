## A Childhood Framed by Simplicity

I grew up in a modest neighborhood in Singapore — a place that taught me how to sit still and listen. My earliest memories aren't of keyboards or screens, but of quiet streets, good food, and structured chaos. That rhythm of life, somehow precise yet unpredictable, would echo later in how I approached software.

We didn't talk about startups. We didn't even talk much about engineering. But we did talk about solving problems. And that instinct — to figure things out, no matter how small — became a kind of compass.

## A Plane Ticket and a New World

When I was accepted into Carnegie Mellon University, it felt like the ground shifted. Pittsburgh was nothing like home. The snow, the pace, the accents — everything required decoding. I was just a student with a suitcase full of ambition and not enough socks for the winter.

But CMU wasn't just an education — it was immersion. Algorithms, hardware, late-night debugging marathons. For the first time, I saw what it meant to build for scale. To write code that lives on. To collaborate with people who spoke in patterns and abstractions and, somehow, made it beautiful.

## The Unseen Moments

I didn't arrive in Silicon Valley with a bang. I didn't have a co-founder or an idea to pitch. I had a small GitHub history, a few friends from school, and the relentless need to *do things right*. My journey through Cisco, CircleUp, and beyond wasn't glamorous — but it was honest.

What you don't see on a resume is what matters most. The panic before your first deployment. The joy of getting a test suite to pass. The awkward silences during your first team meeting when you still think in centimeters and Celsius.

These were my building blocks.

## Not a Genius. Just Consistent.

I wasn't the smartest person in the room. I still rarely am. But I kept showing up. I stayed curious, stayed helpful, stayed stubborn. That mindset carried me from my first intern role to leading teams, building systems, and shipping work that mattered.

If you trace the line from Singapore to where I am now, you won't find fireworks. You'll just find a lot of quiet steps — taken with intention.

## Looking Back, Moving Forward

This post isn't a celebration of success. It's a thank-you note to the version of me that kept walking, even when it wasn't clear where the path was headed.

And to anyone reading this — especially those far from “tech hubs” or “dream schools” — know this: beginnings don't define you. What you build next does.
