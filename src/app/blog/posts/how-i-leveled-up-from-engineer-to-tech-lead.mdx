## Building the Foundation

When I joined Affirm, I started as a Software Engineer and steadily grew into a Senior role. I worked on secure payment infrastructure, real-time credit approvals, and compliance systems that powered transactions at scale.

Over time, I began to take on more ownership—leading projects, mentoring newer engineers, and influencing how we designed resilient backend services. That period taught me the value of reliability, discipline, and clarity in high-stakes environments.

But as Affirm matured, I realized I was ready for a new challenge—one where I could help shape not just systems but also how teams approached emerging technology.

## Stepping Into a New Kind of Leadership

In 2023, I joined Ramp as a Senior Software Engineer. On paper, the title stayed the same. But the expectations—and the opportunity to lead—grew exponentially.

Ramp was scaling fast and investing heavily in AI-powered automation. I became a founding member of the AI technology efforts, driving the development of GPT-4 workflows that automated expense processing and contract analysis. Leading this work meant setting technical direction, aligning cross-functional teams, and mentoring others as we moved into new territory.

## Lessons From the Transition

Moving from Senior Engineer to tech lead responsibilities taught me a few core lessons:

### 1. Influence Is Earned

Leadership isn’t granted by a title—it’s built by consistently delivering, communicating clearly, and helping others succeed. At Ramp, I learned to show up as a stabilizing force in times of ambiguity.

### 2. Technical Depth Still Matters

Even as I spent more time guiding architecture and reviewing designs, staying hands-on was essential. The credibility to lead came from understanding the details deeply.

### 3. Speed and Trust Go Hand in Hand

At a high-growth startup, velocity is critical. But so is maintaining trust—in your systems and your team. Balancing the two was one of the most valuable challenges I’ve faced.

## Challenges and Growth

Stepping into a tech lead role in a scaling environment wasn’t easy:

- We were moving fast, often without perfect information.
- I had to juggle building, mentoring, and shaping strategy simultaneously.
- Designing AI systems that were both accurate and explainable took relentless iteration.

But those challenges are what made it worthwhile. They forced me to grow in ways that no classroom or certification could teach.

## Final Thoughts

Leveling up from Senior Engineer to a tech lead mindset wasn’t about a promotion—it was about stepping into ownership, aligning teams, and building with purpose.

Affirm gave me the foundations. Ramp gave me the canvas to apply them at speed. Together, they shaped how I think about leadership in engineering—and what it means to help teams do their best work.
