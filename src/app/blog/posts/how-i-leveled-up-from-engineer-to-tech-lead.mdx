## Into the Deep End

When I joined Labelbox in 2018, it wasn’t as a junior developer—or even a senior one. It was as a **Software Engineering Lead**.

It was early. The product was evolving fast. AI training pipelines, labeling systems, Python SDKs—everything was in motion. There was no handbook. Just a high-growth team trying to scale quickly and do things that hadn’t been done before.

And I was expected to lead.

## What Prepared Me

Before Labelbox, I was at **DroneDeploy**, building complex frontends for geospatial drone mapping. That experience gave me:

- Strong React and TypeScript fundamentals,
- A sense of ownership over interface design and performance,
- A close understanding of how frontend connected to real-time data layers.

But Labelbox was different. Here, I wasn’t just building UI—I was helping design backend architecture, coordinating across infra and product, and guiding engineers through ambiguity.

## Lessons from Leading Early

Jumping into a tech lead role early forced me to **grow fast**. Here’s what stood out:

### 1. Design Is a Team Sport

Leading meant driving system design across teams—front to back. I had to balance performance with clarity, short-term velocity with long-term scale. That meant writing fewer tickets myself, and spending more time aligning stakeholders and defining interfaces that could evolve.

### 2. Mentorship Is About Multiplication

My goal wasn’t to be the smartest engineer in the room—it was to make **everyone around me faster and more confident**. I started reviewing more code, pairing often, and helping newer devs navigate fast-changing architecture.

### 3. Feedback Is a Leadership Superpower

Being a lead meant both giving and **inviting feedback** constantly—on design, on process, on how we communicate. When you normalize feedback, you reduce friction and build trust.

## Hard But Worth It

The challenges were real:

- Decisions came fast, with imperfect information.
- We had to rebuild and refactor large parts of the platform to meet enterprise needs.
- I often had to **context switch** between strategy and hands-on code multiple times a day.

But I loved it. I learned how to build for scale, how to lead under pressure, and how to speak both “engineer” and “product” fluently.

And I carried that experience into every role since—especially at **Vanta**, where I later led key initiatives around compliance automation and LLM integrations.

## Final Thoughts

Leveling up isn’t about waiting for permission. It’s about **stepping into uncertainty** and figuring it out as you go.

Labelbox gave me that opportunity—and it shaped how I approach engineering leadership to this day.
