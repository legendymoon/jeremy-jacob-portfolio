## The Safe Bet

I started my career at Cisco—one of the most established tech giants in the world. Fresh out of Carnegie Mellon, I was excited to contribute to real-world systems, get mentored by experienced engineers, and learn how software powered massive networks.

And I did. I worked on internal tools, automation pipelines, and integration systems used by global teams. I learned how to write solid code, how to follow processes, and how to operate in a world where stability was everything.

But something didn’t sit right. Every deployment felt like it was moving through molasses. Decisions took quarters. Innovation, while happening, was hidden behind layers of hierarchy.

## Craving Speed, Ownership, and Risk

I wasn’t burned out. I was bored.

I wanted to move faster. To own features. To be in the room where architecture decisions were made—not 17 levels downstream. I didn’t want to just “contribute to systems”—I wanted to **build them**.

So I left the comfort of a full-stack team at Cisco and joined a scrappy startup called CircleUp.

Suddenly, everything changed.

## Welcome to Chaos (and Growth)

At CircleUp, the contrast was immediate:

- I was shipping production code in week one.
- There were no formal QA teams—*you* tested your stuff.
- Every engineer had to know a bit of frontend, backend, infra, and product.
- Mistakes were visible. Wins were too.

I learned more in six months than I had in the previous year. I started to understand customers. I picked up Node.js, React, GraphQL, and modern dev workflows—tools that would shape the rest of my career.

## Why Startups Worked for Me

It’s not that enterprise is bad. It’s just that **I craved velocity**—and ownership.

In startups:
- You move faster because there’s no choice.
- You design, build, and ship as one unit.
- You’re close to the customer, the product, and the business model.
- There’s no hiding behind tickets—your work *is* the roadmap.

That pressure creates intensity. But it also creates **acceleration**—in skill, confidence, and visibility.

## Looking Back

Cisco gave me a solid foundation in code quality, reliability, and discipline.

But it was the startup world—at CircleUp, DroneDeploy, Labelbox, and later Vanta—where I found my **engineering voice**.

Startups taught me how to think in systems, lead through ambiguity, and ship like it matters—because it does.

## Final Thoughts

Would I trade my time at Cisco? Never.

Would I go back? Not unless they started acting like a startup.

Velocity isn't just about speed—it's about **alignment between effort and impact**. That’s why I left enterprise. And that’s why I still build like I'm in a garage—even when I’m working remotely.
