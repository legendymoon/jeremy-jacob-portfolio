title: "Why We Switched to OIDC for Service-to-Service Auth"
summary: "Static tokens got the job done—until they didn't. Here's how OIDC helped us fix brittle auth flows, simplify secret management, and scale internal service communication securely."

## The Breaking Point

It started with a Slack alert about a failed internal API call. At first, we thought it was just a bad deploy. Then it happened again. And again.

The culprit? A **hardcoded bearer token** that had expired but was still in use—across four services.

We realized we were running a system held together by a patchwork of static secrets and hopeful assumptions. It was time for a change.

## Auth Had Become a Liability

Let’s break down what we were dealing with:

- 🔒 Secrets scattered in config files and CI pipelines.
- 🤝 No handshake—just "here’s a token, trust me."
- 🔁 Manual token rotation during late-night hotfixes.
- 📉 No visibility into who was calling what and why.

Every new microservice added more complexity. And more risk.

## Enter OIDC

We didn’t want to reinvent the wheel. We wanted something battle-tested, standards-based, and flexible.  
OpenID Connect (OIDC) gave us:

- Short-lived **JWTs** with verifiable claims
- **Centralized issuance** and automatic expiry
- Support for the **Client Credentials Flow** (ideal for service-to-service)
- **JWKS** endpoints for public-key-based validation

Most importantly, it let us enforce *identity, access, and trust* — not just possession of a shared secret.

---

## What Changed Under the Hood

We defined every service as a client with a unique ID and secret in our IdP (Auth0). When `Service A` needed to talk to `Service B`, it would:

1. Exchange its credentials for a token scoped to `Service B`.
2. Send the token with its requests.
3. `Service B` would validate it using the IdP’s public JWKS URL.

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code:
        `POST /oauth/token

{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "svc-a",
  "client_secret": "...",
  "audience": "svc-b"
}`,
      language: "http",
      label: "Token request"
    }
  ]}
/>

No shared secrets. No manual rotation. No guesswork.

## Surprises Along the Way

This shift wasn’t pain-free. Some lessons hit us early:

- 🔄 **Token expiration hurts** if your service doesn’t retry properly.
- 🔐 **Caching JWKS** is mandatory—fetching it on every request is a footgun.
- ⚠️ **Browser-incompatible flows** meant we kept REST tokens for frontend APIs.
- 🧩 **Scope naming is architecture**. A good naming scheme for scopes avoids spaghetti permissions later.

Still, it was a massive upgrade.

## The Real Payoff

Today, our service-to-service auth:

- 🎯 Is **zero-trust** by design—every call is validated
- 🔍 Is **auditable**—we know who called what, and when
- 🔄 Is **rotated** every hour, automatically
- 🔧 Is **enforced** with a shared middleware across Node, Go, and Python services

We sleep better now.

## Not Just Secure—Clean

One of the biggest wins wasn’t even security. It was **clean architecture**.

By tying identity to services instead of secrets, we made ownership, responsibility, and access explicit. It became obvious which services needed which privileges—and which didn’t.

If you're still passing around long-lived tokens like backstage passes, you might want to ask: _what happens if one of them leaks?_

---

## TL;DR

- Static tokens were fine… until we scaled.
- OIDC gave us rotating, verifiable, scoped tokens.
- We now trust identity, not possession.
- It’s been the single best infrastructure upgrade we’ve made in the past year.
