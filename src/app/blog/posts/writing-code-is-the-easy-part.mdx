summary: "The real challenge at startups isn’t code—it’s aligning with product, managing chaos, and shipping the right thing under pressure. Here’s what makes early-stage engineering truly hard."

## The Myth of “Just Coding”

Early in my career, I thought startups would be all about **hard code problems**—performance tuning, clever algorithms, scaling infrastructure.

And yes, those things show up eventually.

But after working at multiple startups—Labelbox, Vanta, CircleUp, DroneDeploy—I can confidently say this:

> **The code is the easy part.**

The hard part is everything that comes **before** and **after** the code.

## What Makes Startups Actually Hard

### 1. Deciding What to Build

There’s rarely a crystal-clear spec. Sometimes it’s a Slack thread, a Figma draft, and a “we need this next week.”

You need to:
- Ask the right questions.
- Clarify what success looks like.
- Scope it *just enough* to ship without overbuilding.

### 2. Keeping the Big Picture in Mind

Startups require you to:
- Zoom out regularly,
- Align constantly with design and product,
- Prioritize outcomes over output.

Sometimes, the right answer is to not build at all.

### 3. Managing Chaos Without Losing Focus

Things break. Priorities shift. Leadership pivots mid-sprint. Startups don’t have guardrails—you have to create your own.

What separates great startup engineers isn’t how fast they code—it’s how well they adapt under fire.

## The Skills That Actually Matter

- **Negotiating deadlines** without friction  
- **Saying “no” to good ideas** when focus matters more  
- **Supporting teammates** through burnout or scope creep  
- **Refactoring while shipping**, not instead of it  
- **Documenting thought process**, not just syntax

## What I Learned the Hard Way

At Labelbox, I was moving fast—AI workflows, SDKs, pipeline design. The code was real, but the real challenge was:

- Making product decisions without all the data,
- Getting alignment mid-sprint,
- Deciding when to ship “good enough” and when to rework.

I didn’t grow because I optimized algorithms—I grew because I learned how to balance chaos and clarity.

## Final Thoughts

Startups don’t reward elegance—they reward speed, insight, and learning.

So if you’re headed to one:
- Write good code,
- But spend more time sharpening judgment, clarity, and collaboration.

That’s the part most engineers underestimate.
