## More Than Just Syntax

On the surface, code reviews are about correctness:

- Does it work?
- Is it efficient?
- Are the tests passing?

But underneath that logic lies something more human—and harder to measure:

- What tone is this comment in?
- Is this nitpicking or mentoring?
- Why does this feel personal?

Every code review is also a window into your team’s **cultural DNA**.

---

## What Gets Said—and What Gets Felt

Consider two comments on the same line:

- `Can we rename this for clarity?`
- `This name sucks.`

Both address the same issue.  
But one builds trust. The other chips away at it.

> The difference isn’t technical. It’s cultural.

How we review code reflects **what we value**, **how we relate**, and **how safe people feel** when shipping work.

## Norms That Aren’t in the Handbook

Every team has its own *invisible rules*:

- How quickly are reviews expected to land?
- Are senior engineers expected to push back more—or less?
- Is it okay to merge with minor comments unresolved?
- How do you handle disagreement—inline or async?

If new engineers have to “figure it out as they go,”  
that’s not flexibility—it’s **hidden friction**.

---

## The Emotional Economy of Code Reviews

No one says this out loud, but we all know it:

- A fast LGTM feels like trust.  
- A wall of red comments feels like judgment.  
- Silence can feel worse than rejection.

Reviews aren’t neutral. They carry **emotional weight**.  
Especially for junior engineers or those from underrepresented backgrounds.

The smallest phrase—“why did you do this?”—can feel like curiosity or condescension, depending on tone and context.

## Better Culture, Better Reviews

A few cultural nudges can radically improve the experience:

### ✅ Normalize Context First

Start with intention, not critique.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code:
`// Instead of:
Why did you rename this?

// Try:
Just checking—was the rename to improve alignment with the new schema?`,
      language: "ts",
      label: "review-examples.ts"
    }
  ]}
/>

### ✅ Review the Approach, Not the Person

Focus on decision-making, not personal style.

### ✅ Make Praise as Specific as Critique

Don’t just flag what’s broken. Call out what’s elegant, efficient, or thoughtful.

### ✅ Clarify Expectations

Define what’s *blocking* vs what’s *suggestion*.  
Avoid the passive-aggressive “nit (non-blocking)” unless it’s truly non-blocking.

## Final Thoughts

Your codebase has a style guide.  
Your code reviews have a culture—even if no one’s written it down.

The best teams know this, talk about it, and tune it over time.

Because behind every pull request is a person.  
And what they remember isn’t always what you wrote—it’s how you made them feel.
