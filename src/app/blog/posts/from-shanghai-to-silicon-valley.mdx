## A Childhood Framed by Contrast

I grew up in Shanghai, surrounded by a blend of international influences and local traditions. My earliest memories weren’t of startups or venture funding, but of classrooms that taught me curiosity and consistency. It was a place where you learned to pay attention — to details, to people, to possibilities.

We didn’t talk much about venture capital or product-market fit. But we did talk about solving problems, asking good questions, and showing up prepared. That mindset — steady and practical — would become my foundation.

## A Plane Ticket to Michigan

When I was accepted into the University of Michigan, it felt like stepping into another dimension. Ann Arbor’s winters were an education all by themselves. The snow, the pace, the cultural shifts — everything required patience and translation.

Michigan wasn’t just where I learned computer science. It was where I learned how to learn. Data structures, operating systems, late nights in the lab debugging something that refused to make sense. For the first time, I understood what it meant to build things that could last.

## The Unseen Moments

I didn’t graduate with a startup already waiting. I didn’t have a flashy exit lined up or a co-founder to lean on. What I did have was a belief in doing things the right way — and the willingness to keep showing up.

My journey started at Affirm, where I learned how much discipline it takes to build systems that move money securely. From microservices and payment flows to compliance and scale, it was my first chance to work on something that touched millions of people. And while it wasn’t glamorous every day, it was honest work — and that was enough.

## Not a Genius. Just Consistent.

I’ve rarely been the smartest person in the room. I probably never will be. But I’ve tried to be the most reliable. To keep asking questions, keep learning, and keep showing up for my team.

That mindset carried me from debugging my first production issue at Affirm to helping lead initiatives in AI automation at Ramp. Step by step, the work started to compound.

## Looking Back, Moving Forward

This post isn’t a highlight reel. It’s a thank-you note to the earlier version of me who kept going, even when the path felt uncertain.

And to anyone reading this — especially those who feel far from “tech hubs” or “dream companies” — know this: your beginnings don’t define you. What you build next does.
