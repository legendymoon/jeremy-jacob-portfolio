## A Concert I Almost Skipped

June 2024 was busy. I was neck-deep in shipping a new feature, reviewing pull requests, and juggling bugs that somehow all decided to show up the same week. When a friend invited me to a chamber music concert on a Thursday night, I almost said no.

But something told me to go. Maybe it was the need for a reset. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was fate.

The venue was small, intimate, tucked away in a part of Raleigh I hadn’t explored much. The lights dimmed. Musicians walked out. And then she appeared.

## The Cellist

She was calm, focused, and effortlessly graceful. She tucked her cello under her arm and adjusted her endpin. The first note she played was rich, grounded, and—somehow—personal.

That was my first impression of Tracy. A cellist whose music wasn’t just technical; it was emotional. Alive. In that moment, I forgot about servers, APIs, and all things TypeScript.

I just listened.

## The After-Note

After the concert, I lingered. Not because I had a plan—just because I wasn’t quite ready to go back to my world yet. A mutual friend introduced us casually.

“Tracy, meet Ryan—he’s a software engineer. Ryan, Tracy’s the one who made you tear up with a cello solo.”

We talked. Music. Tech. Art. Silence. It wasn’t some dramatic movie scene—no fireworks, no slow-mo. Just a feeling of *click*. Like the right chord resolving after tension. Like syntax compiling without errors.

## Worlds Apart, Perfectly Aligned

She doesn’t write code. I don’t read sheet music. But we found rhythm in conversation.

I loved her curiosity about what I did—how voice agents work, why I care about compliance automation, what "infrastructure-as-code" even means. And I found myself wanting to learn about her—how she chooses a bow, how music lives between the notes, how performance feels from the inside out.

We started with coffee. Then long walks. Then longer talks.

Somewhere along the way, this became *something*.

## What She Taught Me

Falling for Tracy reminded me of something I’d forgotten in startup mode: not everything has to be optimized, shipped, or scaled. Some things are just meant to be felt.

She taught me to listen—not just for what’s said, but for the quiet in between. To appreciate intentionality. To be fully present, even in silence.

I still build systems and chase clean architecture. But now, I also pause to hear her rehearse downstairs. Sometimes, that’s the best part of my day.

## A Final Note

They say you don’t remember most days, only moments. For me, June 13, 2024, is one of those moments.

I walked into that concert stressed and distracted. I walked out quietly changed.

And her name was Tracy.
